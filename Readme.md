# Stock Market Predictor

## Project Description
The **Stock Market Predictor** project focuses on forecasting the future performance of a stock by predicting its close prices. The objective is to provide insights into whether they should Buy, Hold, or Sell a stock based on predicted trends. This is achieved using advanced statistical modeling techniques tailored for time series data.

## Approach

### Data Utilized
- **Historical Stock Prices:** Data that includes past open, close, high, low prices, and trading volumes.
- **Exogenous Factors:** Additional relevant factors that might influence the stock price, such as market indicators or economic data.

### Modeling Technique
The project employs the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous factors (SARIMAX) model. This model is ideal for handling time series data with seasonal patterns and can incorporate external factors to improve prediction accuracy.

### Predictions
The model is trained on historical data to learn patterns and relationships between the stock's open prices and its close prices. It then generates forecasts for future close prices. Based on these predictions, the project provides strategic advice on the optimal action for investors:
- **Buy:** When the stock price is expected to rise.
- **Hold:** When the stock price is expected to remain stable.
- **Sell:** When the stock price is expected to decline.

## Outputs
- **Predicted Close Prices:** A list of future close prices predicted by the model.
- **Investment Strategy:** Recommendations for Buy, Hold, or Sell based on the predicted trends.

## Usage
1. Prepare the necessary datasets (`train.csv` and `test.csv`).
2. Run the prediction script to generate forecasts and investment strategies.
3. Review the output file (`output.csv`) containing predicted close prices and corresponding dates.

## Conclusion
The **Stock Market Predictor** project aims to provide a reliable tool for investors to make informed decisions based on predicted stock trends. By leveraging the SARIMAX model, the project enhances the accuracy of stock price forecasts, helping investors maximize their returns.
